# Sales-Data-Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of sales data to extract valuable insights and uncover trends that can drive business decisions. Using Python for data processing and visualization, and leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, this analysis covers key metrics, visual representations, and machine Learnig.

# Overview

The Sales Data Analysis project provides insights into sales metrics, regional performance, and customer demographics. This project applies machine learning for predicting customer purchase likelihoods, enabling strategic decision-making based on data.
Project Objectives

    Clean and preprocess sales data for accurate analysis.
    Identify trends in sales performance over time.
    Analyze geographic and demographic factors influencing sales.
    Use machine learning to predict sales trends and customer purchase potential.
    Visualize data to convey findings effectively.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Calculated key statistics (mean, median, etc.) for sales and revenue.
    Examined correlations between features, such as customer age and total purchases.
    Created visualizations to showcase trends in sales and customer preferences.
